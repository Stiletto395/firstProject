<h2>Desert Leopards</h2>

<p>A female leopard watched as her young cub pranced about leaping and twirling along the shore of water. She gazed amused as her son tried to catch the small minnows in vain. She finally said, “Khan, you won’t catch any fish jumping and splashing like that. Try sneaking up on them, making sure your paws don’t make a single splash, you may just catch one.” She watched as he tread quietly and then crouched with one front paw raised. He slammed the paw down then with a yelp of joy squeaked, “I caught one! I caught one!” He came back up the shore tail held proudly as he dropped the minnow in front of his mother. “Great job little one, you’ll be a magnificent hunter one day.” Khan rubbed against his mother’s cheek and then asked, “Eat it mother, I caught it for you.” His mother looked thoroughly delighted and responded, “Thank you, if this keeps up, I won’t have to hunt anymore.” Then hooking the tiny fish with one claw she ate it in a bite. “Delicious, Khan, that was the best fish I’ve ever tasted.” “Mother!” Khan laughed, “You couldn’t even taste it, it was so tiny!” “But it was still good,” his mother said, “Because any food given by my son is good. Now go play with your friends.” “Okay, bye.” Khan called over his shoulder as he scrambled away. She watched as he ran off and sighed contentedly. As she settled for a nap, she hoped that the times like these would last forever.</p>
